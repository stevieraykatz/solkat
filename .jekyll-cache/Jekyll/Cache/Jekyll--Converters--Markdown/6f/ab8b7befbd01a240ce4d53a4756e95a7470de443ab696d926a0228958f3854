I"d<p>Architected and implemented a versatile ERC1155 contract for this nascent web3 startup. They aspire to bring the power of tokenization to all shopify storefronts.</p>

<p>After multiple meetings with the technical and management teams, we were able to find a contract architecture that would unlock them for their proof of concept implementation. Since many of their earliest users won’t be web3-native, we needed to solve the “custody problem”. We accomplished this by storing tokens on the contract itself. With a backend hook, the NiftyCat platform can send users their tokens if they so desire.</p>
