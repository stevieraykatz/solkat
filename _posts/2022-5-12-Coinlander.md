COINLANDER is an interactive experiment in the design and development of community gaming primitives, including the Seeker characters and The One Coin artifact.

COINLANDER begins with Season One, a collection of gameified token minting contracts that culminates in a puzzle game with a 64 ETH prize purse. The Season One game is fully developed and deployed at contract deployment — none of the game contracts or game mechanics can ever be changed, and no "road map" needs to be developed for the prize purse to unlock at the end of the game.

Solkat consulting was reponsible for all of the contract architecture, implementation and integration for this project and is still actively involved in its development.
