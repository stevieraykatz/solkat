Designed and implemented a pass-through layer on top of Uniswap enabling the Lejilex dApp to whitelist specific tokensfor trading. The contract employs a transparent proxy for future upgradability and integrates with the UniswapV3 router.

The project encompased writing and testing the contracts through unit testing and fork testing. Additionally Solkat Consulting provided off-chain tools to assist in deploying, verifying, upgrading and managing these contracts.
